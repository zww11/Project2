## PART 1  - Complete grab_headlines
## INPUT: soup - the soup object to process
## Grab the headlines from the "Most Read" section
## and return them in a list
def grab_headlines(soup):
    
    # get the most read div
    
    # get the ordered list from that div
    
    # get the links from the ordered list div
    
    # return the headlines

    pass


## PART 2 Complete a function called get_headline_dict. It will take a soup object and return a dictionary
## with each story headline as a key and each story url as the value
## INPUT: soup - the soup object
## OUTPUT: Return - a dictionary with each story headline as the key and the story url as the value
def get_headline_dict(soup):
    
    # create the empty dictionary
    
    # get the story wrap divs
    
    # get the short headline
    
    # find the link in headline div
    
    # set the dictionary key to the headline and the url as the value

    pass


## PART 3 Define a function called get_page_info. It will take a soup object for a story
## and return a tuple with the title, author, date, and the number of paragraphs
## in the body of the story
## INPUT: soup - the soup object
## OUTPUT: Return - a tuple with the title, author, date, and number of paragraphs
def get_page_info(soup):
    
    # get the title
    
    # get the date
    
    # get the author
    
    # get the number of paragraphs
    
    # return the tuple

    pass

## Extra Credit
## INPUT: the dictionary that was returned from part 2
## OUTPUT: a new dictionary with just items that contain the word U-M or Ann Arbor
